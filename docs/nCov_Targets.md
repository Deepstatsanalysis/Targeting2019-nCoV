# Target Analysis For SARS/MERS and previous related therapeutic efforts

---

## List of SARS/MERS Genes and their functions 

This figure from the "Coronaviruses — drug discovery and therapeutic options" (A. Zumla et al., 2016) review article describes the genome of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. The proteins targets are separated into two different categories: Non-structural and structural. There are four targets listed with  effort for each category of protein.

Additionally, Figure 2 of the same review article shows the virus-based and host-based therapeutic options within the cell. This figure visualizes host and viral targets and illustrates their functions.
