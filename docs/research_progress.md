 * ["Evolution of the novel coronavirus from the ongoing Wuhan outbreak and modeling of its spike protein for risk of human transmission"](http://ghddiai.oss-cn-zhangjiakou.aliyuncs.com/file/file_encwomsp.pdf)
    * Analysis showed that the Wuhan CoV shared a common ancestor with SARS coronavirus that resembles the bat coronavirus HKU9-1. This work points to the RBD domain of the Wuhan CoV S-protein which supports strong interaction with human ACE2 molecules.

 * "Shenyang Pharmaceutical University, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, and Academy of Military Medical Sciences identified pharmaceuticals that can possibly treat 2019-nCoV"    
    * This [article](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/TlI0d4XsfrrFtYHhWI7h6g) reveals several pharmaceuticals that are candidates to be used to treat the recent 2019-nCoV outbreak.

 * ["Learning from the Past: possible Urgent Prevention and Treatment Options for Severe Respiratory Infections Caused by 2019-nCov"](http://ghddiai.oss-cn-zhangjiakou.aliyuncs.com/file/file_lftppuptosar.pdf)
    * The spike protein used for host cell infection although shows mutations but remains a viable target for development of biologics. This paper suggests 3 potential drug candidates: remdesivir, 3CLpro-1, and novel sulfone protease inhibitor to possibly treat patients.

    * The 2019-nCoV is revealed to be a new type of bat coronavirus and is genetically distant from the human SARS coronavirus. Its spike protein only binds weakly to the ACE2 receptor on human cells.

### 2018

 * ["Fatal swine acute diarrhoea syndrome caused by an HKU2-related coronavirus of bat origin"](http://ghddiai.oss-cn-zhangjiakou.aliyuncs.com/file/file_fsadshku2.pdf)
    * This article provides evidence that a bat coronavirus and swine acute diarrhoea syndrome coronavirus is the aetiological agent that was responsible for a large outbreak resulting in the fatal disease of pigs in China. The SADS and SARS outbreaks had similarities in geographical, temporal, ecological, and aetiological settings.

 * ["Cell-based antiviral screening against coronaviruses: Developing virus-specific and broad-spectrum inhibitors"](http://ghddiai.oss-cn-zhangjiakou.aliyuncs.com/file/file_cbasacdcsbsi.pdf)
    * A 2014 review explaining cell-based assays using infectious virus (BSL-3) and surrogate assays (BSL-2) that can be implemented to accelerate antiviral development against SARS, MERS, and future emergent coronaviruses such as the recent 2019-nCoV.

### 2013

 * ["Novel Inhibitors of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus Entry That Act by Three Distinct Mechanisms."](http://ghddiai.oss-cn-zhangjiakou.aliyuncs.com/file/file_nisarscetatdm.pdf)
    * There are no approved treatments as of this article for SARS coronavirus. This article reports the discovery and characterization of several small-molecule inhibitors of SARS-CoV replication through several mechanisms. It showed that their mechanisms of action revealed that the compounds act by three distinct mechanisms: (i) SSAA09E2 {*N*-[[4-(4-methylpiperazin-1-yl)phenyl]methyl]-1,2-oxazole-5-carboxamide} acts through a novel mechanism of action, by blocking early interactions of SARS-S with the receptor for SARS-CoV, angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2); (ii) SSAA09E1 {[(*Z*)-1-thiophen-2-ylethylideneamino]thiourea} acts later, by blocking cathepsin L, a host protease required for processing of SARS-S during viral entry; and (iii) SSAA09E3 [*N*-(9,10-dioxo-9,10-dihydroanthracen-2-yl)benzamide] also acts later and does not affect interactions of SARS-S with ACE2 or the enzymatic functions of cathepsin L but prevents fusion of the viral membrane with the host cellular membrane.

 * ["Structure-Based Discovery of a Novel Angiotensin- Converting Enzyme 2 Inhibitor"](http://ghddiai.oss-cn-zhangjiakou.aliyuncs.com/file/file_sbdnace2i.pdf)
    * The Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is an important therapeutic target for cardiovascular diseases and SARS outbreaks. This study identifies the molecules with the highest predicted binding scores and assays them for ACE2 enzymatic inhibitory activity and for SARS coronavirus spike protein-mediated cell fusion inhibition.
