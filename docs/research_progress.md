* [Genome Detective Coronavirus Typing Tool for rapid identification and characterization of novel coronavirus genomes](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.01.31.928796v1)
    * Genome Detective is a web-based, user-friendly software application to quickly and accurately assemble all known virus genomes from next generation sequencing datasets. This application allows the identification of phylogenetic clusters and genotypes from assembled genomes in FASTA format.
    * Here, we present The Genome Detective Coronavirus Typing Tool that can accurately identify novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) sequences isolated in China and around the world. The tool can accept up to 2,000 sequences per submission and the analysis of a new whole genome sequence will take approximately one minute. The tool has been tested and validated with hundreds of whole genomes from ten coronavirus species, and correctly classified all of the SARS-related coronavirus (SARSr-CoV) and all of the available public data for 2019-nCoV. The tool also allows tracking of new viral mutations as the outbreak expands globally, which may help to accelerate the development of novel diagnostics, drugs and vaccines.

* [Predicting commercially available antiviral drugs that may act on the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV), Wuhan, China through a drug-target interaction deep learning model](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.01.31.929547v1)
    * We used our pre-trained deep learning-based drug-target interaction model called Molecule Transformer-Drug Target Interaction (MT-DTI) to identify commercially available drugs that could act on viral proteins of 2019-nCoV.
    * The result showed that atazanavir, an antiretroviral medication used to treat and prevent the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), is the best chemical compound, showing a inhibitory potency with Kd of 94.94 nM against the 2019-nCoV 3C-like proteinase, followed by efavirenz (199.17 nM), ritonavir (204.05 nM), and dolutegravir (336.91 nM). 
    * Lopinavir, ritonavir, and darunavir are all designed to target viral proteinases. However, in our prediction, they may also bind to the replication complex components of 2019-nCoV with an inhibitory potency with Kd < 1000 nM.
    * In addition, we also found that several antiviral agents, such as Kaletra, could be used for the treatment of 2019-nCoV, although there is no real-world evidence supporting the prediction.

* [Drug treatment options for the 2019-new coronavirus (2019-nCoV)](https://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/bst/advpub/0/advpub_2020.01020/_article)
    * Lopinavir /Ritonavir, Nucleoside analogues, Neuraminidase inhibitors, Remdesivir, peptide (EK1), abidol, RNA synthesis inhibitors (such as TDF, 3TC), anti-inflammatory drugs (such as hormones and other molecules), Chinese traditional medicine, such ShuFengJieDu Capsules and Lianhuaqingwen Capsule, could be the drug treatment options for 2019-nCoV. However, the efficacy and safety of these drugs for 2019- nCoV still need to be further confirmed by clinical experiments

* [Therapeutic Drugs Targeting 2019-nCoV Main Protease by High-Throughput Screening](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.01.28.922922v2)
    * The main protease of SARS-CoV is essential for the life cycle of the virus, which showed 96.1% of similarity with the main proteaseof 2019-nCoV, is considered to be an attractive target for drug development.
    * In this study, we have identified 4 small molecular drugs with high binding capacity with SARS-CoV main protease by high-throughput screening based on the 8,000 clinical drug libraries, all these drugs have been widely used in clinical applications with guaranteed safety, which may serve as promising candidates to treat the infection of 2019-nCoV.

* [Potent binding of 2019 novel coronavirus spike protein by a SARS coronavirus-specific human monoclonal antibody](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.01.28.923011v1)
    * We report for the first time that a SARS-CoV-specific human monoclonal antibody, CR3022, could bind potently with 2019-nCoV RBD (KD of 6.3 nM). The epitope of CR3022 does not overlap with the ACE2 binding site within 2019-nCoV RBD. Therefore, CR3022 has the potential to be developed as candidate therapeutics, alone or in combination with other neutralizing antibodies, for the prevention and treatment of 2019-nCoV infections
    * Some of the most potent SARS-CoV-specific neutralizing antibodies (e.g., m396, CR3014) that target the ACE2 binding site of SARS-CoV failed to bind 2019-nCoV spike protein, indicating that the difference in the RBD of SARS-CoV and 2019-nCoV has a critical impact for the cross-reactivity of neutralizing antibodies, and that it is still necessary to develop novel monoclonal antibodies that could bind specifically to 2019-nCoV RBD

    * We built homology models based on SARS Mpro structures, and docked 1903 small molecule drugs to the models.
    * Both MM/GBSA and SIE methods voted for **nelfinavir**, with the binding free energy of -24.69±0.52 kcal/mol and -9.42±0.04 kcal/mol, respectively.

 * ["Host and infectivity prediction of Wuhan 2019 novel coronavirus using deep learning algorithm"](http://ghddiai.oss-cn-zhangjiakou.aliyuncs.com/file/file_hipwncdla.pdf)
    * Using deep learning algorithms, this article builds a virus host prediction model in order to predict the potential virus hosts. The built model suggests that 2019-nCoV has close infectivity with other human coronaviruses, especially SARS and MERS. Additionally, by comparing predicted infectivity patterns, bat coronaviruses are  assigned  with  more  similar  infectivity  patterns  with  2019-nCoVs. It was also suggested that mink viruses show a closer infectivity pattern to 2019-nCov showing that bat and mink may be two candidate reservoirs  of  2019-nCov.

    * This article shares a recent development where researchers developed an approach to rapidly screen lineage B betacoronaviruses, and their ability to infect cell types from different species. They found that bypassing the host protease processing barrier allows several lineage B viruses to enter human cells. These different lineage B viruses can also recombine to gain entry into human cells with human ACE2 being the receptor for 2019-nCoV.

* ["From SARS-CoV to Wuhan 2019-nCoV Outbreak: Similarity of Early Epidemic and Prediction of Future Trends"](http://ghddiai.oss-cn-zhangjiakou.aliyuncs.com/file/file_fswncoseep.pdf)
    * The ongoing outbreak in China caused by the 2019-nCoV is very similar in many aspects  to SARS in 2003. This article, using epidemiological surveys and analyses from the early stage of the SARS outbreak, assesses and compares characteristics of these two outbreaks. Using the current data, the cumulative counts of 2019-nCoV cases was estimated about 2-3 times the total number of SARS, and the peak incidence is predicted to be in early or middle February. It is suggested that regional migration should be limited or prohibited to prevent the emergence and movement of a super-spreader.

* ["Sofosbuvir Can Inhibit the Newly Emerged Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) in Wuhan, China"](http://ghddiai.oss-cn-zhangjiakou.aliyuncs.com/file/file_scinecncwc.pdf)
    * This article aims to study the effect of anti-polymeras drugs including Sofosbuvir and Ribavirin. Sequence analysis, modeling, and dociking are used to build a model for the 2019-nCoV. The results of this study suggests that Sofobuvir, IDX-184, and Ribavirin are able to tightly bind to the newly emerged coronavirus RdRp and contradict the function of the protein. Therefore, it is likely these drugs are an effective inhibitor of this virus.

This article reports the discovery and characterization of several small-molecule inhibitors of SARS-CoV replication through several mechanisms. It showed that their mechanisms of action revealed that the compounds act by three distinct mechanisms: (i) SSAA09E2 {*N*-[[4-(4-methylpiperazin-1-yl)phenyl]methyl]-1,2-oxazole-5-carboxamide} acts through a novel mechanism of action, by blocking early interactions of SARS-S with the receptor for SARS-CoV, angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2); (ii) SSAA09E1 {[(*Z*)-1-thiophen-2-ylethylideneamino]thiourea} acts later, by blocking cathepsin L, a host protease required for processing of SARS-S during viral entry; and (iii) SSAA09E3 [*N*-(9,10-dioxo-9,10-dihydroanthracen-2-yl)benzamide] also acts later and does not affect interactions of SARS-S with ACE2 or the enzymatic functions of cathepsin L but prevents fusion of the viral membrane with the host cellular membrane.
