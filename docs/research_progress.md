 * [Machine intelligence design of 2019-nCoV drugs](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.01.30.927889v1)
    * A family of potential 2019-nCoV drugs generated by a machine intelligence-based generative network complex (GNC) is reported in this study. A SARS-CoV protease inhibitor dataset from ChEMBL, and a binding affinity training set comtaining PDBbind data were used for this model. The model prediccts 8000 potential drugs evaluated based on a latent space binding predictor and a 2D fingerprint predictor. Drug candidates are further evaluated by deep learning models, and logP, logS, and SA score were computed. These results indicate that anti-2019-nCoV compounds built in this study are in the top 15 and are predicted to work better than anti-HIV drugs current used like lopinavir and ritonavir.

 * ["Host and infectivity prediction of Wuhan 2019 novel coronavirus using deep learning algorithm"](http://ghddiai.oss-cn-zhangjiakou.aliyuncs.com/file/file_hipwncdla.pdf)
    * Using deep learning algorithms, this article builds a virus host prediction model in order to predict the potential virus hosts. The built model suggests that 2019-nCoV has close infectivity with other human coronaviruses, especially SARS and MERS. Additionally, by comparing predicted infectivity patterns, bat coronaviruses are  assigned  with  more  similar  infectivity  patterns  with  2019-nCoVs. It was also suggested that mink viruses show a closer infectivity pattern to 2019-nCov showing that bat and mink may be two candidate reservoirs  of  2019-nCov.

 * [Predicting commercially available antiviral drugs that may act on the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV), Wuhan, China through a drug-target interaction deep learning model](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.01.31.929547v1)
    * We used our pre-trained deep learning-based drug-target interaction model called Molecule Transformer-Drug Target Interaction (MT-DTI) to identify commercially available drugs that could act on viral proteins of 2019-nCoV.
    * The result showed that atazanavir, an antiretroviral medication used to treat and prevent the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), is the best chemical compound, showing a inhibitory potency with Kd of 94.94 nM against the 2019-nCoV 3C-like proteinase, followed by efavirenz (199.17 nM), ritonavir (204.05 nM), and dolutegravir (336.91 nM). 
    * Lopinavir, ritonavir, and darunavir are all designed to target viral proteinases. However, in our prediction, they may also bind to the replication complex components of 2019-nCoV with an inhibitory potency with Kd < 1000 nM.
    * In addition, we also found that several antiviral agents, such as Kaletra, could be used for the treatment of 2019-nCoV, although there is no real-world evidence supporting the prediction.

 * [Potent binding of 2019 novel coronavirus spike protein by a SARS coronavirus-specific human monoclonal antibody](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.01.28.923011v1)
    * We report for the first time that a SARS-CoV-specific human monoclonal antibody, CR3022, could bind potently with 2019-nCoV RBD (KD of 6.3 nM). The epitope of CR3022 does not overlap with the ACE2 binding site within 2019-nCoV RBD. Therefore, CR3022 has the potential to be developed as candidate therapeutics, alone or in combination with other neutralizing antibodies, for the prevention and treatment of 2019-nCoV infections
    * Some of the most potent SARS-CoV-specific neutralizing antibodies (e.g., m396, CR3014) that target the ACE2 binding site of SARS-CoV failed to bind 2019-nCoV spike protein, indicating that the difference in the RBD of SARS-CoV and 2019-nCoV has a critical impact for the cross-reactivity of neutralizing antibodies, and that it is still necessary to develop novel monoclonal antibodies that could bind specifically to 2019-nCoV RBD
