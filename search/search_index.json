Meanwhile, we are making our drug discovery capabilities and resources available at no cost to all researchers who are developing new treatments for 2019-nCoV. We hope this initiative will accelerate the process of drug discovery for this deadly viral disease. The initial effort includes the following : 1) GHDDI will make its high throughput screening platform and multiple compound libraries available to all researchers for target-based or phenotypic-based screens. These compound libraries include the ReFRAME compound library (the world\u2019s largest collection of its kind, containing over 12,000 known drugs, most of which have gone through Phase I clinical studies), a diversity-based synthetic compound library, a natural product library, a traditional Chinese medicine extract library, etc. We welcome research groups with high quality 2019nCoV related enzymatic assays or phenotypic assays to discuss long term collaboration plans for ReFrame library screening. 2) GHDDI will make its high-end computational chemistry and virtual screening platform available to all researchers on Alibaba Cloud. Using the most advanced algorithms and methods, researchers can choose to model/dock existing drug libraries and/or tens of millions of virtual compounds using target structures by high-resolution crystallography or through homology modeling. 3) GHDDI will make its AI drug discovery and big data platform available to all researchers. The open-access integrated datasets include various data from previous drug discovery efforts against SARS and MERS, and other related viruses. Also, it will provide data on drug repurposing prediction against this new coronavirus. Furthermore, the online portal will continue to provide all relevant information to the scientific community as well as the public about the latest scientific studies on the new coronavirus. 4) GHDDI will collaborate with CROs (with deep gratitude to the commitment and contribution made by BioDuro) to offer services including small-molecule chemical synthesis, drug design, medicinal chemistry, DMPK, target protein generation/biophysics/structural biology, etc. 5) GHDDI will provide consultation on disease biology, pharmaceutical sciences and drug discovery. GHDDI has established several first-class research platforms in the areas of medicinal chemistry, lead generation/high-throughput screening, CADD and AI-based drug discovery, structural biology, DMPK and animal facility. We hope to share our expertise and resources and collaborate with partners who have relevant disease biology or complementary drug discovery and development expertise with an interest toward finding new treatment for the novel coronavirus. In addition, GHDDI has extensive partnerships with over 20 research institutions, pharmaceutical companies and disease alliances in China and worldwide. We are confident that, with concerted efforts by all stakeholders, we will conquer this novel coronavirus! Guide for Discussion You can participate in community discussions here . You're also welcome to join our discussion for any scientific subject, feature request, and bug report. Who We Are We're from GHDDI (The Global Health Drug Discovery Institute).

Here, we discuss the potential for repurposing existing antiviral agents to treat 2019-nCoV, some of which are already moving into clinical trials. 2016 \"Coronaviruses \u2014 drug discovery and therapeutic options\" Review of epidemiology, virology, clinical features, and current treatment strategies of SARS and MERS in 2016. This review article also includes a discussion of the drug discovery and development of new therapeutic options for CoV infections. 2008 \"SARS coronavirus Accessory Proteins\" Evidence points to the fact that accessory proteins may play an important role in modulating the host response to virus infection and contribute to pathogenesis. This review compiled the existing knowledge SARS-CoV accessory proteins and attempts to explain the possible roles of these proteins in the propagation and virulence of SARS-CoV in its host. 2020 2020, Feb 25 * \"Functional assessment of cell entry and receptor usage for SARS-CoV-2 and other lineage B betacoronaviruses\" * This article shares a recent development where researchers developed an approach to rapidly screen lineage B betacoronaviruses, and their ability to infect cell types from different species. They found that bypassing the host protease processing barrier allows several lineage B viruses to enter human cells. These different lineage B viruses can also recombine to gain entry into human cells with human ACE2 being the receptor for 2019-nCoV. * Preprint released on January 22, 2020. Published on February 25, 2020 2020, Feb 21 * \"A Multiscale and Comparative Model for Receptor Binding of 2019 Novel Coronavirus and the Implication of its Life Cycle in Host Cells\" * A computational study with results indicating that the association of the new virus to the receptor is slower than SARS. This difference was integrated into a rigid-body mathematical model and found that this can result in a longer incubation period while maintaining a relatively higher level of viral concentration in the human body. 2020, Feb 18 \"Structure of dimeric full-length human ACE2 in complex with B0AT1\" 2.9 \u00c5 resolution cryo-EM structure of full-length human ACE2 in complex with B0AT1 is presented in this study. The complex exhibits open and closed conformations due to the shifts of the peptidase domains of ACE2. Structural modelling suggests that this complex can bind two S proteins simultaneously. 2020, Feb 16 \"Cryo-EM Structure of the 2019-nCoV Spike in the Prefusion Conformation\" This study produced 3.5 A-resolution structures of the 2019-nCoV S trimer in the prefusion conformation. Additionally, results from this study indicate that this S protein binds ACE2 with higher affinity than the previous SARS-CoV S protein through biophysical and structural evidence. 2020, Feb 13 \"Potentially highly potent drugs for 2019-nCoV\" Drug repurposing was used in this study to identify many FDA approved drugs are potentially active against 2019-nCoV. This was done using a SARS 3CL protease X-ray crystal structure to create a 3D homology structure. Additionally, protein-ligand complexes were used as training data for a deep learning model to predict binding affinities; 1465 FDA-approved drugs were tested and the predicted binding affinities were reported in this study's results section. 2020, Feb 11 \"The Essential Facts of Wuhan Novel Coronavirus Outbreak in China and Epitope-based Vaccine Designing against 2019-nCoV\" This article describes a study to design possible epitope-based subunit vaccines against the 2019-nCoV using a variety of strategies. Many amino acid sequences were published in this study, including three vaccine construct sequences. 2020, Feb 7 \"Potential 2019-nCoV 3C-like protease inhibitors designed using generative deep learning approaches\" This article from Insilico Medicine utilizes its generative chemistry pipeline to design novel molecules for 2019-nCoV through several generative chemistry approaches. Inputs for this model include 2019-nCoV 3C-like protease crystal structure, homology model, co-crystalized fragment, and a protease datasets. Several structures were generated and shown in the paper's results section. The most recent data results are on their official website: insilico.com/ncov-sprint. 2020, Feb 6 \"2019-nCoV: new challenges from coronavirus\" According to current observations, 2019-nCoV is weaker than SARS in pathogenesis, but has stronger transmission competence; it's mechanism of cross-species spread might be related with angiotensin-converting enzyme \u2161 (ACE2), which is consistent with the receptor SARS-CoV. The emergence of 2019-nCoV reminds us once again of the importance of establishing a systematic coronavirus surveillance network. It also poses new challenges to prevention and control of the emerging epidemic and rapidly responses on scientific research. 2020, Feb 5 \"Network-based Drug Repurposing for Human Coronavirus\" The researchers present an integrative, antiviral drug repurposing methodology implementing a systems pharmacology-based network medicine platform, quantifying the interplay between the HCoV-host interactome and drug targets in the human protein-protein interaction network. Using network proximity analyses of drug targets and known HCoV-host interactions in the human protein-protein interactome, the researchers computationally identified 135 putative repurposable drugs for the potential prevention and treatment of HCoVs, and prioritized 16 potential anti-HCoV repurposable drugs (including melatonin , mercaptopurine , and sirolimus ) that were further validated by enrichment analyses of drug-gene signatures and HCoV-induced transcriptomics data in human cell lines. Three potential drug combinations (including sirolimus plus dactinomycin, mercaptopurine plus melatonin, and toremifene plus emodin) captured by the Complementary Exposure pattern. \"Genomic variance of the 2019-nCoV coronavirus\" A phylogenetic tree was constructed of novel coronavirus as well as other coronaviridae such as bat coronavirus and SARS. The sequence similarity of >99% was confirmed between all 2019-nCoV genomes, and the closest bat coronavirus genome shared a 96.2% sequence identity. A proteomic comparison with other coronaviridae was also performed and key aminoacidic differences were identified for potential antiviral strategies. \"Learning from the Past: Possible Urgent Prevention and Treatment Options for Severe Acute Respiratory Infections Caused by 2019-nCoV\" The spike protein used for host cell infection although shows mutations but remains a viable target for development of biologics. Other key drug targets, including RdRp and 3CLpro, share a strikingly high (>95%) homology to SARS\u2010CoV. This paper suggests 4 potential drug candidates: an ACE2\u2010based peptide, remdesivir, 3CLpro-1, and novel sulfone protease inhibitor to possibly treat patients. Preprint released on January 27, 2020. Published on February 5, 2020 2020, Feb 4 \"Remdesivir and chloroquine effectively inhibit the recently emerged novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) in vitro\" This Letter to the Editor article first identifies several existing antiviral drugs to treat related viral infections. Through standard in vitro assays, the researchers found that remdesivir and chloroquine are highly effective in the control of 2019-nCoV infection in vitro, and recommend further human patient assessment based on these drugs' previous safety track record on human patients. \"Machine learning-based analysis of genomes suggests associations between Wuhan 2019-nCoV and bat Betacoronaviruses\" Machine learned models and digital signal processing were used to classify 2019-nCoV genomes. After mapping using a two-dimensional numerical representation, the magnitude spectra was computed using a Discrete Fourier Transform. Afterwards, a distance matrix was calculated using Pearson Correlation Coefficients and were used as features for different machine learning algorithms. Through 10-fold cross validation, the classification accuracy for coronavirus was over 90%, indicating that 2019-nCoV can be classified closest to sarbecovirus within betacoronavirus. \"Baricitinib as potential treatment for 2019-nCoV acute respiratory disease\" Using BenevolentAI knowledge graph to search for approved drugs that could help 2019-nCoV, baricitinib is predicted to reduce the ability of the virus to infect lung cells. This study focuses on the disruption of AAK1 which might interrupt the passage of the virus into cells and also the intracellular assembly of virus particles. One of the six high-affinity AAK1-binding drugs was baricitinib, and this may have potential to reduce both the viral entry and the inflammation in patients. Machine intelligence design of 2019-nCoV drugs A family of potential 2019-nCoV drugs generated by a machine intelligence-based generative network complex (GNC) is reported in this study. A SARS-CoV protease inhibitor dataset from ChEMBL, and a binding affinity training set comtaining PDBbind data were used for this model. The model prediccts 8000 potential drugs evaluated based on a latent space binding predictor and a 2D fingerprint predictor. Drug candidates are further evaluated by deep learning models, and logP, logS, and SA score were computed. These results indicate that anti-2019-nCoV compounds built in this study are in the top 15 and are predicted to work better than anti-HIV drugs current used like lopinavir and ritonavir. \"Preliminary identification of potential vaccine targets for 2019-nCoV based on SARS-CoV immunological studies\" This study attempts to gain insight into vaccine design against 2019-nCoV. There is high genetic similarity between this virus and SARS coronavirus. Therefore, by screening SARS-CoV-derived B cell and T cell epitopes, a set of B cell and T cell epitopes derived from spike and nucleocapsid proteins mapped identically to 2019-nCoV proteins. There were no mutations observed meaning immune targeting of these epitopes may offer protection against 2019-nCoV. 2020, Feb 3 Gilead Sciences and 2019 Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) Remdesivir from Gilead Sciences enters Phase III clinical trials in China on February 3, 2020. An official news release from Gilead expressing their committment to respond to this outbreak by testing their novel investigational compound remdesivir in a controlled clinical trial as a treatment for 2019-nCoV. 2020, Feb 2 Genome Detective Coronavirus Typing Tool for rapid identification and characterization of novel coronavirus genomes Genome Detective is a web-based, user-friendly software application to quickly and accurately assemble all known virus genomes from next generation sequencing datasets. This application allows the identification of phylogenetic clusters and genotypes from assembled genomes in FASTA format. Here, we present The Genome Detective Coronavirus Typing Tool that can accurately identify novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) sequences isolated in China and around the world. The tool can accept up to 2,000 sequences per submission and the analysis of a new whole genome sequence will take approximately one minute. The tool has been tested and validated with hundreds of whole genomes from ten coronavirus species, and correctly classified all of the SARS-related coronavirus (SARSr-CoV) and all of the available public data for 2019-nCoV. The tool also allows tracking of new viral mutations as the outbreak expands globally, which may help to accelerate the development of novel diagnostics, drugs and vaccines. \"Host and infectivity prediction of Wuhan 2019 novel coronavirus using deep learning algorithm\" Using deep learning algorithms, this article builds a virus host prediction model in order to predict the potential virus hosts. The built model suggests that 2019-nCoV has close infectivity with other human coronaviruses, especially SARS and MERS. Additionally, by comparing predicted infectivity patterns, bat coronaviruses are assigned with more similar infectivity patterns with 2019-nCoVs. It was also suggested that mink viruses show a closer infectivity pattern to 2019-nCov showing that bat and mink may be two candidate reservoirs of 2019-nCov. Predicting commercially available antiviral drugs that may act on the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV), Wuhan, China through a drug-target interaction deep learning model We used our pre-trained deep learning-based drug-target interaction model called Molecule Transformer-Drug Target Interaction (MT-DTI) to identify commercially available drugs that could act on viral proteins of 2019-nCoV. The result showed that atazanavir, an antiretroviral medication used to treat and prevent the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), is the best chemical compound, showing a inhibitory potency with Kd of 94.94 nM against the 2019-nCoV 3C-like proteinase, followed by efavirenz (199.17 nM), ritonavir (204.05 nM), and dolutegravir (336.91 nM).

It showed that their mechanisms of action revealed that the compounds act by three distinct mechanisms: (i) SSAA09E2 { N -[[4-(4-methylpiperazin-1-yl)phenyl]methyl]-1,2-oxazole-5-carboxamide} acts through a novel mechanism of action, by blocking early interactions of SARS-S with the receptor for SARS-CoV, angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2); (ii) SSAA09E1 {[( Z )-1-thiophen-2-ylethylideneamino]thiourea} acts later, by blocking cathepsin L, a host protease required for processing of SARS-S during viral entry; and (iii) SSAA09E3 [ N -(9,10-dioxo-9,10-dihydroanthracen-2-yl)benzamide] also acts later and does not affect interactions of SARS-S with ACE2 or the enzymatic functions of cathepsin L but prevents fusion of the viral membrane with the host cellular membrane.","title":"2013"},{"location":"research_progress/#2008","text":"\"SARS coronavirus Accessory Proteins\" Evidence points to the fact that accessory proteins may play an important role in modulating the host response to virus infection and contribute to pathogenesis.
